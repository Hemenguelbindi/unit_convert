# Unit converter

(Unit converter)[https://roadmap.sh/projects/unit-converter]
You are required to build a simple web app that can convert between different units of measurement. It can convert units of length, weight, volume, area, temperature, and more. The user can input a value and select the units to convert from and to. The application will then display the converted value.

Build a simple web page that will have different sections for different units of measurement. The user can input a value to convert, select the units to convert from and to, and view the converted value.

The user can input a value to convert.
